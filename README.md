# Exoplanets Data 1

The dataset of confirmed exoplanets (PSCompPars_2023.04.03_23.35.45.csv) is provided.
The list of questions to be answered using the dataset are:

QUESTION 1: Find the number of planets with radius in the range (0.5 to 1.6 REarth)?

QUESTION 2: Find the number of planets with radius in the range (0.5 to 1.6 REarth) around FGK stars? List them in a table. Make a plot of Equilibrium temperature vs Distance from Earth for these planets. How many of them have been discovered by direct imaging method?

QUESTION 3: Find the number of planets with radius in the range (1.6 to 4 REarth) around FGK stars? List them in a table. 

QUESTION 4: Make a plot of radius vs. mass of all the planets in the dataset and also mark Earth, Venus and Jupiter in the plot with their respective images. 

QUESTION 5: Make a plot of radius vs. stellar metallicity and mass vs. stellar metallicity for all the planets. Use linear/log scale as required. Comment on the plot. 

QUESTION 6: Plot the density of all the planets (that have both mass and radius) as a function of their radius. Comment on the plot.
